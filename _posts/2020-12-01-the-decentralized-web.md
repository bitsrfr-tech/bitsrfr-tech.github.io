Imagine a future where anybody can provide hosting services and get paid for it, even if they only have a desktop PC. Imagine a future where content creators don’t need to sell advertising space on their websites. Imagine a future where everybody pays to use the web and anybody can get paid to host the web.

Some people would choose to use the web, but not host it. They would pay, but not get paid. Some people would choose to use the web *and* host it. They would pay, and they would get paid. Some people will choose to host larger portions of the web. They will be paid more.

No matter who chooses what, if the decentralized web (d-web) becomes standard, things will be a little more fair. We won’t need large organizations to host everything for us. Subsequently, we won’t be paying as much because there won’t be middlemen taking their share, and their won’t be bureaucracy taking its share.

### What is the Decentralized Web?

Many call it Web3. The d-web is a world wide web similar to today’s web, but with a few tweaks. Primarily, the d-web lends itself to being hosted on many small nodes rather than on a few large nodes. **Think democracy vs monarchy.**

In today’s web, almost everything we do is hosted by Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook, or Microsoft (AppAmaGooFaceSoft). In the d-web, you, your friends, and your neighbors, are the hosts. If your friend wants to store his files in the “cloud,” he will store them on your computer, and many other computers, instead of Google’s computers or Amazon’s computers. Of course, his files will be encrypted so that you can’t see them, and of course, you will be paid for making part of your computer’s hard drive available.

D-web services don’t require big organizations. There are no titanic cloud servers. It is just a bunch of nodes, many small, some large. The little guys can play the same game as the big guys, and they get paid the same way.

### How the Decentralized Web Works

The d-web works much like a local farmer’s market. People offering products or services are paid directly for the services they offer. People looking for products/services pay the providers.

If my personal computer has 500 GB of available hard drive space, and I don’t mind sharing it, I can host a node on a distributed network. An algorithm will look at the space I offer, and the quality of service I provide (uptime, bandwidth, etc), and pay me in cryptocurrency based on those statistics.

Somebody looking to store their files can pay cryptocurrency to the system, and upload their files. Their files will be hosted not only on my system, but on hundreds or millions of other systems. Each person providing hard drive space is paid accordingly.

As a provider, I don’t have to deal directly with anyone. I just start up a node hosting program and get paid in cryptocurrency. The rules are set by a smart contract (an algorithm), and the cryptocurrency ledger makes sure everything is fair.

***There are no politics or emotions spinning things around.***

As a provider, I don’t have to worry about committing to a certain level of uptime or quality of service. I simply earn less cryptocurrency if my service is poor or offline.

When my service does go offline, it won’t hurt the folks using the service because there will still be many other nodes that are online. Those hosts pick up the slack. I don’t get paid while my service is offline, but I also don’t have angry customers reaming me out. I don’t have to promise “99.99% uptime” or anything like that, and the folks using my service don’t have to worry about holding me responsible for that.

In the d-web, much of the BS that comes along with normal business will be eliminated. Service providers can operate just fine without managers or CEOs scraping money off the top of their earnings. There is no need for bureaucracy. All of that is handled by the machine. Instead, the money goes straight to the heart, the workers, the ones making the whole thing happen.

Interestingly, this reduces the power of marketing and branding. A company with a well-known brand won’t be able to print money simply because of its brand. Brands won’t be something that sub-par service can hide behind.

In many cases, the best strategy for a hosting provider will be to host nodes in close proximity to their clients because latency times will be better. This may be good for the economy as a whole. [Small is beautiful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Is_Beautiful).

Hosts will be paid based on the quality of the service they provide, not on the popularity of their brand. As far as hosting goes, there won’t be a need for branding. Instead, folks shopping for hosting can look at real-world stats and prices. In fact, shopping won’t be necessary at all. They will pay cryptocurrency, and the protocol will manage the rest. The service will be as good as the many distributed nodes in the system.

In a worst case scenario, AppAmaGooFaceSoft hosts a majority of the available nodes in the d-web, and they go offline. Things will be slower, but service won’t be completely disrupted. The small nodes will keep things running.

Of course, it is not all roses and rainbows. The d-web cannot be controlled by a government. I believe this is primarily a good thing, but it will be up to the people to stop hosts or clients that are doing harmful things like using computers that run excessively and eat up fossil fuels or hack into other systems. If a majority of the d-web citizens have a good sense of morality, the bad guys can be stopped. Plus, smart contracts can regulate much negative behavior.

In today’s web, where big companies and governments rule the land, bureaucracy is a necessary evil. With the d-web, it is not. In the d-web, bureaucratic BS is handled by algorithms. The rest is handled by the thousands of nodes provided by citizens who want a little extra cash for their extra hard drive space, or who want to be able to access the d-web without being charged too much.

In tomorrow’s decentralized web, things will be run by everybody, not just the big guys. We can’t know whether that will be good or bad, or both. But it certainly seems to be a more natural and fair system than what we have today.
