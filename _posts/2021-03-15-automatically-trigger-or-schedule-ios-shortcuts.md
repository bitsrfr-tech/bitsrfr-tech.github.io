title: Automatically Trigger or Schedule iOS Shortcuts

It is hidden in plain sight. If you create an [iOS Shortcut](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios) and search for a piece of logic that will trigger the Shortcut to run at a scheduled time, you won't find it.

Nonetheless, iOS Shortcuts can be scheduled or triggered to run without the use of third-party apps or even any hacks. Scheduling and triggering is baked into Shortcuts. It's just not in with all of the other Shortcuts actions.

The Automation portion of Shortcuts is not listed with all of the other Shortcut actions that you will find when you are on the Shortcut creation screen. Automation is part of the Shortcuts app, but it has its own section/tab.

Check out the screenshots below to see where to find the Automation tab on iPad and iPhone in landscape and portrait modes.

There is one additional step required in triggering or scheduling a Shortcut. The Automation tab in Shortcuts allows you to set a trigger for or schedule an action. You must, then, use a Shortcuts action (*Get My Shortcuts*, *Open Shortcut*, or *Run Shortcut*) to run the Shortcut of your choice when triggered or scheduled.

Further down on this page, I have a full list (as of February 2021) of the available Automation options in iOS Shortcuts.
